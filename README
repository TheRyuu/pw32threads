Crippled Pthreads - A pthreads wrapper for w32threads 
Inspired by mpw6g.

Takes the pthreads wrapper for w32threads from x264 and makes it a little more generic to allow use 
as a lib.  Removes the limitation of Vista+ from mpw6g.

I honestly don't see much use for this other that situations when linking to pthreads-w32 has
problems (like msvc x64 linking of mingw libs, if you are doing this add -D_SYSCRT to the cflags).

Speed is identical to pthreads-w32 (it's not crippled in that sense).

To Compile (same as mpw6g):

CROSS_PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-
INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw
all:
    $(CROSS_PREFIX)gcc -std=c99 -o pthread.o -c pthread.c -Wall -O2
    $(CROSS_PREFIX)ar cru libpthread.a pthread.o
    cp libpthread.a $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/lib
    cp pthread.h $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/include
